        <h1>Tools for the hobby.</h1>
        <p>If you are just starting, all you need are a good pair of scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, and a lighter.</p>

        <p>Nylon is a durable material, so it is recommended that you use high-quality scissors to make cutting it easier.</p>

        <p>
           Having a tool to measure parachute cord is important because many projects require specific lengths of cord.
           Measuring will help you make sure you don't have to restart a project because of too much or too little cord.
           It will also help you reduce the amount of wasted cord.
        </p>

        <p>
            A lighter is needed because parachute cord is made out of nylon, which melts when exposed to intense heat.
            Melting the ends of parachute cord will protect it from fraying and falling apart with use. 
            If you want to melt parachute cord faster or you need to melt a specific part of a project, a jet flame lighter may be helpful.
            A jet flame lighter burns hotter than a traditional bic lighter and focuses the flame into a column, which is easier to direct. 
        </p>

        <h1>More advanced tools for the hobby.</h1>
        <p>
            If you have practiced knot tying for a while and want to improve the quality of your work,
            there are more specialized tools to help achieve that.
        </p>

        <p>
           A marlin spike is a bar with a narrow point at one end. 
           It is used for leverage to untie very tight knots and for pulling slack out of loose knots.
        </p>

        <p>
            A fid is a special needle you screw onto the end of a piece of parachute cord.
            It makes tying complex or tight knots easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hemostats are a tool that functions similarly to pliers. They can lock in place, which makes them a useful for holding strands of parachute cord in place.
            The tips of hemostats are narrow, which also makes them useful for pulling parachute cord through tight spots on projects.
