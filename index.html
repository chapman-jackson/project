            <h1>Parachute cord introduction.</h1> 
            <p>
                Parachute cord, also known as paracord, is a nylon rope that was originally used for parachutes in World War II.
                Its strong and lightweight nature has found use for many things outside of military combat.
                It is a popular choice for campers, handymen, and those who are involved in emergency preparedness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Paracord comes in a variety of colors, which makes it a popular material for craftsmen to use.
                Bracelets, lanyards, belts, and dog leashes are some of the many things that can be made with paracord.
            </p>
